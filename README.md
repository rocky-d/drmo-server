### Introduction

#### What is it?

...

#### Why is it called "drmo-server"?

The word "drmo" in the project name is actually the abbreviation of the four supported danger types - "DEER", "REINDEER", "MOOSE", and "OTHER". And it's also an HTTP/HTTPS server. That's why it is called "drmo-server". 🎄🎄🎄🦌🦌🦌🌐🌐🌐

### Environment

This is only the information of my own development environment:

- Windows 10
- Java 8
- Maven 3.9.2

### Usage

- Build the project with **Maven**.
- Run the main method in the `ServerLauncher` class to start the server.
- Follow the instructions of the program if it's **the first run**.
  - Don't panic if you see an error message. Calm down and read the prompts carefully.
  - Choose whether to load the default configuration. (Type `yes` or `y` and then press `enter`.)
  - Check and modify (if you need to) the config file.
  - Restart the program.
